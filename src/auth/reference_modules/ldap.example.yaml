# Settings used to map a user to a role. The module expects that all user to
# role mapping objects are children of a single root object whose DN and
# objectclass needs to be specified (`root_dn` and `root_objectclass`). The
# module then searches all children of the root object to find an object that
# has an attribute (`mapping_attribute`) that is equal to the user's DN. The
# object's `role_attribute` is then used to determine the user's role.
# NOTE: If you don't want to determine roles using LDAP, just leave the
# `root_dn` parameter empty.

  # Object that contains all user to role mapping objects
